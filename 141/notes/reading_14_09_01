Basics of syntax

use #define to declare values of "magic numbers" that have resounding impact on the behavior of your program. Think of this as a settings section.
These defined values will be replaced in your code at compilation.


functions/loops and their bracing 


main()
{
/* comes afer a newline */
}

while() {
/* comes after the parens */
}



Thoughts on brevity vs explicivity 
	"This version centralizes the input - there is now only one reference to
getchar - and shrinks the program. The resulting program is more com-
pact, and, once the idiom is mastered, easier to read. You'll see this style
often. (It's possible to get carried away and create impenetrable code, how-
ever, a tendency that we will try to curb.)" -Ritchie
