Dominance of algorithms
	Exponential algorhithms fail quickly 
		-Only appropriate for small data
	Quadratic algorithms practical until 10^6
	O*nlogn until 10^9
	O*logn "never sweats

	little o notation means "grows strictly slower than following function"

	a function is said to dominate the other if when n approaches infinity, the function devided by the other approaches 0. 
	if the same approach is taken and the result is > 0 then it does not dominate. 


DOMINANCE RANKING TABLE
	n! >> 2^n >> n^3 >> n^2 >> nlogn >> n >> logn >> 1
	
FURTHER RANKING
	n! >> c^n >> n^3 >> n^2 >> n^(1+e) >> nlogn >> n >> sqrt(n) >> (logn)^2 >> logn >> logn/loglogn >> loglogn >> a(n) >> 1


how many times can we halve n before getting to 1? 
	lgn times. -> inverse of the exponential
	this is important for binary search
