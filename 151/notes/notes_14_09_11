There is dispute over whether natural numbers begin at 1 or 0

use Z- Z Z+ Z0 notation for clarity (all modifiers to be written as superscript)

statement: everybody likes football
negation:  there exists someone who doesn't like football 
       	 - note how this is not "no one likes football"
	 - it is not "everybody hates football" because that would require 
	 - some insight into what the function of hate is with respect to "like"	 - to analyze this properly, we must take "like" as just an 
	 - anonymous function l(). 
	 - logic is sans conotation, sans abiguity, sans symantics


need to review DeMorgan's law and how to translate real sentences into logical statements


order of quantifiers matters in a statement.


The negation of "there exists" (backwards E) -> for all
The negation of "for all" (upsidedown A) -> there exists

p || !p is a tautology

in general there is no algorhythm that will take in an expression and tell whether or not it is a theorem. What a bummer. Sorry Turing.  

"Microsoft is trying to buy minecraft for 2 Billion dollars". Holy fuck.
