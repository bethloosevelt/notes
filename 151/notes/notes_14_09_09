if we can say that a value being false leads to a contradiction, 
we can then assume this value must be true. 

example. 

you are working as a clerk. 
if you have won the lottery you would not being working. 

therefore you have not won the lottery. 
proof by contradiction. 

assume the assumption is false, this constrains the assumptions to false as well
"see what happens to the original"

C:=you are working as a clerk
(L -> !C) and C -> overall must be false

			therefore not L

no statement can be both correct and complete.

pythagorean theorem in propositional logic.

how to formulate that there are infinitely many primes?

this class is so interesting but I feel like I'm going to die. 

predicate logic. : propositions with variables
	- the letter _ is a variable
	- without a place holder it is not a proposition
		- neither true nor false
	- a proposition isi only a proposition if it is either true or false
	- a perdicate has a truth set of all the values that evaluate it 
		- as a true statement. 

proving the communal prop of addition:
	for all integers x and all integers y, x + y = y + x 

the existential quantifier
	E(backwards)y,y**2 = y
	says -> there exists some y where y**2=y
	there is no domain specified. could be rocks. 
	the truth of the predicate depends on the domain

A(upsidedowm)E, x<y
	for all integers x, there exists some y where x < y. 
	This just says "infinity is a thing" 
	which. is terrifying really.

so how do we translate?
	can't really write that down here. 
	check out Fermat's theorem. proved in 1994. wow. 
	
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_last_theorem

	also checkout goldbach conjectures.
		- write the predicate for the all numbers greater than 
			2 are a sum of two primes
