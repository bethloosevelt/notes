Homework 1 has been released
	Due in class tuesday september 9th
	see blackboard for details
	
	do a practice problem involving a large compound truth table. 

	-------------------------------------------------------------


Entire system is built on nand gates. -> !(and)

DeMorgans law:

	!(p&&q) == !p || !q
	!(p||q) == !p && !q	
	
	Distributive laws
		P||(P&&q) == (p||q)&&(p||q)
		etc (see table)
	-> if the truth tables are equivilent, the operations are equivilent

	Certain expressions can be simplified down
		- compilers will simplify logic down to a small set of 
		  compares to make your code more efficient for you. 
		"the most readable is not the most efficient"
		- why not both...


Conditional statements

	if p then q
		- p is called the hypothesis; q is the conclusion
		- the statement is only false when hypothesis is true, but the conclusion is false.
		- this was the only promise made by the statement
		- either may be true independently of our hypothesis


		- a statement is logically equivilent to its contrapositive
		- a biconditional statement is equivilent to all of its inverse,converse, contrapositive
