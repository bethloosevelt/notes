basics of compiler and unix operation
	gcc, clang, etc	

When running an application, shell searches bin first
	- /usr/bin/vim for example
	


compilation steps:

	tokenization and parsing (lexical analysis)
		doesn't want to think about a file as a sequence of 
		characters, but as tokens
		gramatical analysis (left to right operations etc)

	code generation
		uses intermediate files

	linking (used to be a unix program called ln, now part of gcc)
		resolve calls to lib functions (unresolved refference err)
		produce executable file


	-> for grammar of C, see back of Khernighan and Ritchie book


expression
	base case:   number
	abstraction: concatonate operators on. +, -, () etc


asshole kid fails to impress (yet again) with basic knowlege of syntax.
