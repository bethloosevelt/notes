professor: theys

ITA tech challenge. Thursday, SEL 2254 (50 seats)
> exam? fuck that

exam 1 is on 9/29 (thursday of career fair) -> is on cahpters 1 through 3

reading notes:
	moores law:
	processing power is doubled every two years. Theys says 18 months. 
	wikipedia says it is all about transistor count actually. 

	variables are stored in registries while being operated on in an 
	x86 architecture
	
	There are 8 registers in an x86 chip
	eax - al is lowere 8 bits of lower half, ah is high of low. eh/el 
	    - simmilar respectively 
	ebx
	ecx
	edx
	esp - special for stack. stack pointer
	ebp - special for stack
	esi
	edi
	take the e off and you have 16 bit registers for backwards compatibility
	
	addi	ah, #3 ;add immidiate to high byte in eax

for looking into asm
	object dump gives adresses, gcc doesn't
	if you want the translated to machine code commands, use object dump
	"gdb"
	
review: 2's compliment. how to do it quickly. 
	push and pop with the stack

	pushl command means pushing a full 32 bit register. 
	example
		movl	$0, -8(%ebp)
		; this says mov long 00000... into address stored in ebp + (-8)
		movl	$0, ebp
		; would just move 0000... into the ebp registry

	leal	4(esp), ecx
		read operand from 4+address in esp -> store that in ecx
	leal stores an address. So yea we got some math for free here.
