logic - 
	doundation is descrete mathematics
	Explicivety is crucial
	
	Formal logic begins with a statement
		- a statement is either explicitly true or false 			  wthout variance or evaluaion 
	
	Logical operators:
		not (-| ! ~ ...) -> flips bit
		and (&& + ^ ...) -> 1 iff both parts are true
		or  (|| v )	 -> 1 if one part is true	
		xor (o + x)      -> 1 iff ONE part is true 
		
		-can evaluate xor with only ! ^ v
		r = (p && !q) || (!p && q)
			
		p | q | r

		1 | 0 | 1
		0 | 1 | 1
